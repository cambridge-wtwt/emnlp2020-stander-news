### Dataset

STANDER is a large dataset of news articles in English from high-reputation sources which discuss four recent mergers and acquisitions (M&A) operations between  major  healthcare  companies  in  the  US. The news articles are annotated by experts and labeled for stance detection and fine-grained evidence retrieval. 

STANDER contains the same targets as in the Twitter stance detection WT–WT corpus [WT–WT corpus](https://github.com/cambridge-wtwt/acl2020-wtwt-tweets) ([Conforti et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00388)). The union of both corpora thus provides a great opportunity for studying the interplay between authoritative and user-generated signals.
